<HR><H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
 
<P>BET (Brain Extraction Tool) deletes non-brain tissue from an
image of the whole head. It can also estimate the external skull
surface.

<P>For more detail on BET and an updated journal reference, see the <A
HREF="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/research/bet/">BET research
web page</A>. If you use BET in your research, please quote the
journal reference listed there.

<p>The different BET programs are:
<UL>
<LI><a href="#Bet">Bet</a> - BET GUI<br>
<LI><a href="#bet">bet</a> - command-line BET program<br>
<LI><a href="#betfunc">betfunc</a> - command-line script using bet to
process 4D FMRI data
<LI><a href="#bet_robust">bet_robust</a> - command-line script to
improve the robustness of BET (for example) when there is lots of neck
present in the input data

<A NAME="Bet"></A><hr><H2>Bet GUI</H2>

<H3>MAIN OPTIONS</H3>

<P>First set the <b>Input image</b> filename and the <b>Output
    image</b> filename. The output name is also used to generate the
    filenames for any optional outputs that are turned
    on in <b>Advanced options</b>.
 
<P>Changing <B>Fractional intensity threshold</B> from its default
value of 0.5 will cause the overall segmented brain to become larger
(<0.5) or smaller (>0.5). This threshold must lie between 0 and 1.

<p>If you turn on <b>Use robust centre-of-brain estimation</b> then
  the wrapper script <b>bet_robust</b> will be called instead
  of <b>bet</b> (see below); note that if you set any other BET
  options in the GUI then <b>bet_robust</b> will pass these on to BET.

<H3>ADVANCED OPTIONS</H3>
 
<P>By default the only output from BET is an image with all non-brain
matter removed - this is the <B>Output brain-extracted image</B>
option.

<P>The <B>Output binary brain mask image</B> option tells BET to
output a binary brain mask (0 outside of the brain and 1 inside). This
can then be used in later processing, to mask other images derived
from the original.

<P>The <B>Apply thresholding to brain and mask image</B> option causes
BET to apply thresholding to the segmented brain image (and also the
brain mask if selected). Thus, inside the estimated brain, some voxels
can be "zeroed" after segmentation, if their intensity falls below an
automatically estimated threshold.

<P>The <B>Output exterior skull surface image</B> option tells BET
to produce an image which is an estimate of the exterior surface of
the skull. All non-skull-surface points are 0 in this image, and
skull-surface points are 100.

<p>The 
<B>Output brain surface overlaid onto original image</B> option
creates an output image which is a copy of the original image, with
additionally an outline of the brain's surface drawn on top.

<P>Changing <B>Threshold gradient</B> from its default value of 0
causes a gradient to be apply to the previous threshold. Thus setting
a positive value here causes the primary threshold to be reduced at
the bottom of the brain, giving a larger brain estimate there, and a
smaller estimate of the brain towards the top of the image. This value
must lie between -1 and 1.

<A NAME="bet"></A><HR><H2>bet COMMAND-LINE PROGRAM</H2>

<p>Type <b>bet</b> to get usage.
  
<A NAME="betfunc"></A><HR><H2>betfunc COMMAND-LINE SCRIPT</H2>

<p>Type <b>betfunc</b> to get usage; the input and output filenames
must be the filename roots (i.e. without any filename extension). This
script uses <b>bet</b> to determine a brain mask on the basis of the
first volume in a 4D data set, and applies this to the whole data
set. This is principally intended for use on FMRI data, for example to
remove eyeballs. Because it is normally important (in this
application) that masking be liberal (ie that there be little risk of
cutting out valid brain voxels) the -f threshold is reduced to 0.3,
and also the brain mask is "dilated" slightly before being used.

<p>Note that if you just use <b>bet</b> on 4D data, this will work;
the brain mask is derived from the first time point, and then applied
to all time points.

<A NAME="bet_robust"></A><HR><H2>bet_robust COMMAND-LINE SCRIPT</H2>

<p><b>bet_robust</b> is a very simple script, which repeatedly
  calls <b>bet</b>, each time using the same input image and the same
  options, except that the <b>-c</b> option (which sets the starting
  centre of the brain estimation) is set each time to the
  centre-of-gravity of the previously estimated brain extraction. The
  primary purpose is to improve the brain extraction when the input
  data contains a lot of non-brain matter - most likely when there is
  a lot of neck included in the input image. By iterating in this way
  the centre-of-gravity should move up each time towards the true
  centre, resulting in a better final estimate. The iterations stop
  when the centre-of-gravity stops moving, up to a maximum of 10 iterations.

<A NAME="betpremask"></A><HR><H2>betpremask COMMAND-LINE SCRIPT</H2>

<p>Type <b>betpremask</b> to get usage; the input and output filenames
must be the filename roots. This script uses <b>flirt</b> to register the input
image to a standard space whole-head image; the resulting transform is
then inverted and a standard-space brain mask is transformed into the
space of the input image, and then applied to this to create the
output.

<p><b>betpremask</b> can be useful if BET cannot be made to work
well.
