<p>The <a href="http://ric.uthscsa.edu/">Research Imaging Center,
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio</a> provides
programs which take in Talairach co-ordinates and then interrogate
their Talairach labelling database over the internet (their database
is accessible directly via the <a
href="http://biad73.uthscsa.edu/">The Talairach Daemon</a>). We have
integrated these into MEDx.

<UL>

<LI>There appears to be an inconsistency between some supposedly
"Talairached" brains (e.g., MNI 305) and the Talairach daemon
labels

<LI>Please note the objection that some people make to the whole
philosophy behind this kind of procedure, i.e., misgivings about
relying on any automated method of anatomic labelling.

</UL>

<p>To use, bring up an image in Talairach space, and then select
<b>MEDx->FMRIB->General->Talairach Daemon</b>. MEDx will be put into
<b>3D Marker</b> mode. Use the left mouse button to place a marker
anywhere in the image. The marker can also be moved using the left
button once placed. Then press the <b>Click ... press here</b> button,
and the position will be processed and reported. This can be repeated
many times with new markers. All markers and all reports can be
cleared using the <b>Clear</b> button. Note that two types of data are
returned, Talairach labels (from the atlas) and Structure Probability
Map probabilities (from many segmented brains).

<p>The programs used are available from <a
