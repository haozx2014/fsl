<h3>proj_thresh</h3>
<b>proj_thresh</b> is a command line utility that provides an alternative way of
expressing connection probability in connectivity-based segmentation.  It is
run on the output of <a href="fdt_probtrackx.html"> <b>probtrackx</b></a> when <b>classification targets</b> are used.

<p>The output of <b>Connectivity-based seed classification</b> is a single volume for
each target mask, named <b>seeds_to_{target}</b> where {target} is replaced
by the file name of the relevant target mask. In these output images, the
value of each voxel within the seed mask is the number of samples seeded
from that voxel reaching the target mask. 
<br><b>proj_thresh</b> is run as follows:
<p><b>proj_thresh list_of_volumes threshold</b></p>
Where the list of volumes is the outputs of <b>Connectivity-based seed
classification</b> (i.e., files named seeds_to_target1 etc etc) and threshold is expressed as a number of samples
<br>For each voxel in the seeds mask that has a value above threshold for at
least one target mask, <b>proj_thresh</b> calculates the number of samples reaching each target mask
as a proportion of the total number of samples reaching any target mask.  The
output of <b>proj_thresh</b> is a single volume for each target mask.

<h3>find_the_biggest</h3>
<b>find_the_biggest</b> is a command line utility that performs hard
segmentation of a seed region on the basis of outputs of <a
href="fdt_probtrackx.html"><b>probtrackx</b></a> when <b>classification targets</b> are being used.

<p>The output of <b>Connectivity-based seed classification</b> is a single volume for
each target mask, named <b>seeds_to_{target}</b> where {target} is replaced
by the file name of the relevant target mask. In these output images, the
value of each voxel within the seed mask is the number of samples seeded
from that voxel reaching the target mask. <b>find_the_biggest</b> classifies
seed voxels according to the target mask with which they show the highest
probability of connection. It is run as follows:
<p><b>find_the_biggest list_of_volumes outputname</b>
Where the list of volumes is the outputs of <b>Connectivity-based seed
classification</b> (i.e., files named seeds_to_target1 etc etc).

<p>The example below uses <a href="fdt_probtrackx.html"><b>probtrackx</b></a> and find_the_biggest to perform hard segmentation
of the thalamus on the basis of its connections to cortex.

<h3>vecreg - Registration of vector images</h3>

<p>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT height=200 SRC="fdt_images/fdt_vecreg.gif"
ALT="vecreg applied to V1">  
After running dtifit or bedpostx, it is often useful to register vector data to another space. For example, one might want to represent V1 for different subjects in standard space. <b>vecreg</b> is a command line tool that allows to perform such registration.<br><br>
Vector images cannot be registered by simply applying a transformation (as calculated by, say, <a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/flirt/index.html">FLIRT</a>) to every voxel's coordinates. The corresponding vectors have to be reoriented accordingly (see D. Alexander 2001, IEEE-TMI 20:1131-39). <b>vecreg</b> performs this operation for you.
The image on the right shows the effect of applying vecreg (right) to the V1 image on the left, compared to simply applying voxelwise transformation (e.g. using applyxfm4D) to the vectors (centre).
<br><br>
<b> Important: </b> vecreg does not calculate a transformation, but simply applies a given transformation to the input vector field. vecreg can apply a linear transformation calculated with FLIRT, or a non-linear transformation calculated by FNIRT.

<p>

types of input that may be used for vecreg<br>
from <a href="fdt_dtifit.html"><b>dtifit</b></a>: V1,V2,V3,tensor<br>
from <a href="fdt_bedpostx.html"><b>bedpostx</b><a>: dyads1, dyads2, etc. <br>

<h3>qboot - Estimation of fibre orientations using q-ball ODFs and residual bootstrap</h3>

<p>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT height=300 SRC="fdt_images/qboot.gif"
ALT="Different types of ODFs that can be inferred">
<b>qboot</b> is a command line tool that allows estimation of diffusion ODFs and fibre orientations from them. Its output can be used as an input for probtrackX in order to perform probabilistic tractography.<br><br>

ODF estimation is performed using a real spherical harmonics basis. Fibre orientations are estimated as the local maxima of the ODFs. Both deterministic and probabilistic estimation can be performed. For the latter, residual bootstrap is performed to infer on the ODF shape and obtain a distribution of fibre orientations. For more details on the implementation see (S.N. Sotiropoulos, I. Aganj, S. Jbabdi, G. Sapiro, C. Lenglet and T.E. Behrens, "Inference on Constant Solid Angle Orientation Distribution Functions from Diffusion-Weighted MRI", OHBM, 2011).<br><br> 

<b>qboot</b> allows reconstruction of q-ball ODFs (Tuch, MRM, 2004), CSA ODFs (Aganj et al, MRM, 2010) and variants of them, obtained via Laplacian sharpening and Laplace-Beltrami regularization (Descoteaux et al, MRM, 2007). Both spherical harmonic coefficients of the reconstructed ODFs and fibre orientation estimates may be returned as ouput. 
<br><br>

<p>

<b>Input files for qboot </b>: Similar to dtifit and bedpostx, qboot needs a 4D data file, a binary mask_file, a bvecs and a bvals file.
