<a name="intro"></a><p><hr><H2>Introduction</H2>

<p>There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance
diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity
in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white
matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from
diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how
strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging
studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical
analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development,
degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by
the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not been a
satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from
multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be
drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis.  Furthermore, the
arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not been
resolved. TBSS aims to solve these issues via a) carefully tuned
nonlinear registration, followed by b) projection onto an
alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA
skeleton"). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and
interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging
studies.

<p><i>Brief summary text:</i> Voxelwise statistical analysis of the FA
data was carried out using TBSS (Tract-Based Spatial Statistics,
[Smith 2006]), part of FSL [Smith 2004]. TBSS projects all subjects'
FA data onto a mean FA tract skeleton, before applying voxelwise
cross-subject statistics.

<p><i>More detailed summary text:</i> Voxelwise statistical analysis
of the FA data was carried out using TBSS (Tract-Based Spatial
Statistics, [Smith 2006]), part of FSL [Smith 2004]. First, FA images
were created by fitting a tensor model to the raw diffusion data using
FDT, and then brain-extracted using BET [Smith 2002]. All subjects' FA
data were then aligned into a common space using the nonlinear
registration IRTK [Rueckert 1999,
www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dr/software]. Next, the mean FA image was created
and thinned to create a mean FA skeleton which represents the centres
of all tracts common to the group. Each subject's aligned FA data was
then projected onto this skeleton and the resulting data fed into
voxelwise cross-subject statistics.

<a name="overview"></a><p><hr><H2>Running TBSS - Overview</H2>

<p>Running TBSS first involves running a few simple steps/scripts:

<UL>

<LI><b>preprocessing</b> - create FA images from your diffusion study data

<LI><b>tbss_1_preproc</b> - prepare your FA data in your TBSS working
  directory in the right format

<LI><b>tbss_2_reg</b> - apply nonlinear registration of all FA images into standard space

<LI><b>tbss_3_postreg</b> - create the mean FA image and skeletonise it

<LI><b>tbss_4_prestats</b> - project all subjects' FA data onto the mean FA skeleton

<LI><b>stats (e.g., randomise)</b> - feed the 4D projected FA data
  into GLM modelling and thresholding in order to find voxels which
  correlate with your model.

</UL>

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ details -->

We now go through the TBSS steps in detail.

<!-- {{{ 0 - create FA data from a diffusion MRI study -->

<a name="0"></a><hr><h3>0 - create FA data from a diffusion MRI study</h3>

In order to run TBSS you need to create a single FA image from each
subject in the study. We recommend that you do this using tools in the
<a href="../fdt/index.html">FDT</a> FSL toolbox; in brief:
<br>1. Correct your original data for the effects of head movement and
eddy currents using <code>eddy_correct</code>
<br>2. Create a brain mask by running <code>bet</code> on one of the
B=0 (no diffusion weighting) images
<br>3. Fit the diffusion tensor model using <code>dtifit</code>

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ 1 - tbss_1_preproc -->

<a name="1"></a><hr><h3>1 - tbss_1_preproc</h3>

You now need to create a new, empty directory (folder) in which you will run
the TBSS analysis, for example:

<pre>mkdir mytbss</pre>

Then copy into there all of your subjects' FA images, giving each
subject's FA image a different name. You will make later analysis
easier if you name the images in a logical order, for example so that
all controls are listed before all patients:

<pre>cd mytbss
ls
  CON_N00300_dti_data_FA.nii.gz
  CON_N00302_dti_data_FA.nii.gz
  CON_N00499_dti_data_FA.nii.gz
  PAT_N00373_dti_data_FA.nii.gz
  PAT_N00422_dti_data_FA.nii.gz
  PAT_N03600_dti_data_FA.nii.gz</pre>

You are now nearly ready to run the first TBSS script, which will
scale the FA values to be between 0 and 10000 and convert the format
to uncompressed Analyze with positive voxel dimensions (because the
nonlinear registration software IRTK requires this format). Before
running the first TBSS script, you need to know approximately what the
values in your FA data are (e.g. roughly in the range 0:1). If you
created your FA data using dtifit in FDT then the data will indeed be
roughly in the range 0:1. You can check this, for example, by:

<pre>fslstats CON_N00300_dti_data_FA -R
 0.000000 1.148992</pre>

If the range is close to 0:1 then the default scaling of 10000 will be
correct. Otherwise, you need to tell the script what scaling to apply;
for example, if your data is in the range 0:1000 then you need a
scaling of 10, etc. Now run the script, from inside your working TBSS
directory:

<pre><b>tbss_1_preproc *</b></pre>

(the <code>*</code> expands to the list of input images). Or, if you want to apply scaling &lt;SCALE&gt;, instead type:

<pre>tbss_1_preproc -f &lt;SCALE&gt; *</pre>

The script will now scale and convert the data, placing it in a
newly-created sub-directory called <code>FAi</code>. It will also create
a sub-directory called <code>origdata</code> and place all your original
images in there for posterity.

<p>Finally, the script runs <code>slicesdir</code>, which creates an
overview webpage containing a static view of each of the preprocessed
input images, so that you can then quickly view each of them for
obvious problems.

<!-- <p>Note that the first 3 TBSS scripts (tbss_1_preproc, tbss_2_reg and -->
<!-- tbss_3_postreg must all be run on computers of the same "type" -->
<!-- (e.g. all 32-bit linux, or all 64-bit Apple); this is because the -->
<!-- files used by the IRTK registration software don't always work the -->
<!-- same on different computer hardware. -->

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ 2 - tbss_2_reg -->

<a name="2"></a><hr><h3>2 - tbss_2_reg</h3>

The next TBSS script runs the nonlinear registration, aligning all FA
images to a 1x1x1mm standard space. The target image used in the
registrations can either be a pre-defined target, or can be
automatically chosen to be the most "typical" subject in the study.

<p>In general we recommend using the <a
href="FMRIB58_FA.html">FMRIB58_FA</a> standard-space image as the
target in TBSS. This involves carrying out just one registration per
subject and generally gives good alignment results. This option is
applied by using the <code>-T</code> flag. Alternatively, you can
supply your own target image by using the <code>-t</code> option.

<p>The third option is to align every FA image to every other one,
identify the "most representative" one, and use this as the target
image. This target image is then affine-aligned into MNI152 standard
space, and every image is transformed into 1x1x1mm MNI152 space by
combining the nonlinear transform to the target FA image with the
affine transform from that target to MNI152 space. This option is
selected by using the <code>-n</code> flag, and is the recommended
option if you need to generate a study-specific, for example if the
subjects are all young children (and hence the adult-derived
FMRIB58_FA target is inappropriate).

<p>Direct registration to the high resolution FMRIB58_FA image takes
about 5 hours x N subjects (when running on a single computer). In
comparison, the all-subjects-to-all-subjects option takes about 20
minutes x N x N. Hence the latter approach can take much longer to run
than the former. In either case, you can speed up the registrations by
using multiple computers. This is now described in detail:

<p>If you have several computers that you can run the registration on,
  this is straightforward as long as they can all see the working data
  directory and are all of the same "type" (e.g. all 32-bit linux, or
  all 64-bit Apple); this is because the files used by the IRTK
  registration software don't always work the same on different
  computer hardware. In order to use multiple computers, simply log on
  to each (in a separate terminal window for each), <code>cd</code> to
  the TBSS working directory, and run the <code>tbss_2_reg</code>
  script. Each time the script is run it looks for registrations which
  still need running and, one at a time, runs those which haven't yet
  been done. Note that if you have computers with more than one CPU,
  you can open as many terminals as you have CPUs, and run the script
  in each one.

<p>Once <b>all</b> the scripts have finished running, you are ready to
  move onto the next step.

<p>Alternatively, if your lab has a batch submission system (e.g.,
  SGE) then you may want to amend the TBSS script to take advantage of
  this - then all the registration jobs get submitted to the batch
  system for optimal processing. In this case, ask your system
  administrator to edit $FSLDIR/bin/tbss_2_reg and possibly edit the
  two lines starting with the one testing for "SGE_ROOT", in order to
  make the necessary submission to your batch system. In this case you
  only need to run the TBSS script once; this submits all the
  registrations to your batch system, and you need to watch for them
  all to complete before moving on to the next stage of TBSS.

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ 3 - tbss_3_postreg -->

<a name="3"></a><hr><h3>3 - tbss_3_postreg</h3>

<p>The next TBSS script applies the nonlinear transforms found in the
previous stage to all subjects to bring them into standard space.

<p>If the previous stage was run with the <code>-n</code> option (find
the most typical subject as the target), then this script first needs
to make the decision about which of your FA images is the most
"typical", for selection as the target image to apply all nonlinear
transformations into the space of. (The script does this by taking
each FA image in turn, and estimating the average amount of warping
that was necessary to align all other images to it; it then finds the
one that had the smallest amount of average warping when used as a
target.) Obviously if you pre-specified the FA target image then this
step is automatically skipped. The script then takes the target and
affine-aligns it into 1x1x1mm MNI152 space - this resolution is chosen
as the later skeletonisation and projection steps work well at this
resolution, and the choice of working in MNI152 space is chosen for
convenience of display and coordinate reporting later. Once this is
done, each subject's FA image has the nonlinear transform to the
target and then the affine transform to MNI152 space applied,
resulting in a transformation of the original FA image into MNI152
space (actually the two transformations are combined before being
applied, to avoid having to resample the image twice).

<p>The above results in a standard-space version of each subject's FA
  image; next these are all merged into a single 4D image file called
  <code>all_FA</code>, created in a new subdirectory called
  <code>stats</code>. Next, the mean of all FA images is created,
  called <code>mean_FA</code>, and this is then fed into the FA
  skeletonisation program to create <code>mean_FA_skeleton</code>.

<p>All of the above is done simply by running the script:

<pre><b>tbss_3_postreg -S</b></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you wish to use the FMRIB58_FA mean FA image and
its derived skeleton, instead of the mean of your subjects in the
study, use the <code>-T</code> option:

<pre><b>tbss_3_postreg -T</b></pre>

<p>In general we would recommend using the <code>-S</code> option
(derive the mean FA and skeleton from the actual subjects you have).

<p><img src="eg_skel_all_FA.png" align="right"> The script finishes by
telling you to check whether a suitable threshold for the mean FA
skeleton is 2000 (i.e., mean FA of 0.2 in the skeleton - the default
used by the next script). For example, load the 4D FA data and the
skeleton into FSLView:

<pre>cd stats
fslview all_FA mean_FA_skeleton</pre>

<p>Then change the colourmap for the skeleton to Green, and set its
  display range to be 2000:8000. Now turn on the movie loop; you will
  see the mean FA skeleton on top of each different subject's aligned
  FA image. If all the processing so far has worked ok the skeleton
  should look like the examples shown here (see the TBSS paper for
  more examples of different subjects' results underneath the
  skeleton). If the registration has worked well you should see that
  in general each subject's major tracts are reasonably well aligned
  to the relevant parts of the skeleton. If you set the skeleton
  threshold (in FSLView, the lower of the display range settings) much
  lower than 2000, it will extend away towards extremes where there is
  too much cross-subject variability and where the nonlinear
  registration has not been able to attain good alignments. Remember
  the skeleton threshold for the next stage.

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ 4 - tbss_4_prestats -->

<a name="4"></a><hr><h3>4 - tbss_4_prestats</h3>

<p>The last TBSS script carries out the final steps necessary before
  you run the voxelwise cross-subject stats. It thresholds the mean FA
  skeleton image at the chosen threshold - a common value that works
  well is 2000 (see above). To run, type:

<pre><b>tbss_4_prestats 2000</b></pre>

replacing the <code>2000</code> with another value if you need to
change it.

<p>The resulting binary skeleton mask defines the set of voxels used
  in all subsequent processing. Next a "distance map" is created from
  the skeleton mask. This is used in the projection of FA onto the
  skeleton (see the TBSS paper for more detail). Finally, the script
  takes the 4D all_FA image (containing all subjects' aligned FA data)
  and, for each "timepoint" (i.e., subject ID), projects the FA data
  onto the mean FA skeleton. This results in a 4D image file
  containing the (projected) skeletonised FA data. It is this file
  that you will feed into voxelwise statistics in the next section.

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ 5 - voxelwise statistics on the skeletonised FA data -->

<a name="5"></a><hr><h3>5 - voxelwise statistics on the skeletonised FA data</h3>

<p>The previous step resulted in the 4D skeletonised FA
  image <code>all_FA_skeletonised</code> (in the <code>stats</code>
  subdirectory). It is this that you now feed into voxelwise
  statistics, that, for example, tells you which FA skeleton voxels
  are significantly different between two groups of subjects.

<p>One recommended way of doing the stats is to use
  the <code>randomise</code> tool. For more detail see
  the <a href="../randomise/index.html">randomise manual</a>. Before
  running <code>randomise</code> you will need to generate a design
  matrix file, e.g., <code>design.mat</code> and contrasts file,
  e.g., <code>design.con</code>. You can use the
  script <code>design_ttest2</code> in the simple case of a two-group
  comparison. Alternatively you can use the <b>Glm</b> GUI to generate
  these design matrix and contrast files. Note that the order of the
  entries (rows) in your design matrix <i>must</i> match the
  alphabetical order of your original FA images, as that determines
  the order of the aligned FA images in the final 4D
  file <code>all_FA_skeletonised</code>; check this with:

<pre>
cd FAi
ls -1 *FAi.hdr
</pre>

<p>For example, say you have 7 controls (with original filenames
  <code>CON_001_dti_FA.nii.gz</code> etc.) and 11 patients (with
  original filenames <code>PAT_001_dti_FA.nii.gz</code> etc.). You can
  generate design files and run voxelwise statistics and inference
  using randomisation, including cluster-based thresholding, using:

<pre>
cd ../stats
design_ttest2 design 7 11

randomise -i all_FA_skeletonised -o tbss -m mean_FA_skeleton_mask -d design.mat -t design.con -n 5000 -c 3 -V

fslview MNI152 mean_FA_skeleton -l Green -b 2000,8000 tbss_tstat1 -l Red-Yellow -b 3,6 tbss_tstat2 -l Blue-Lightblue -b 3,6
</pre>

<p>In this case, contrast 1 gives the control&gt;patient test and
  contrast 2 gives the control&lt;patient test. The raw
  (unthresholded) tstat images are <code>tbss_tstat1</code>
  and <code>tbss_tstat2</code> respectively. The cluster p-value
  images (fully corrected for multiple comparisons across space)
  are <code>tbss_maxc_tstat1</code> and <code>tbss_maxc_tstat2</code>
  (note, these are actually 1-p for convenience of display, so
  thresholding at .95 gives significant clusters).

<!-- {{{ non-FA -->

<a name="nonFA"></a><p><hr><H2>Using non-FA Images in TBSS</H2>

<p>It is straightforward to apply TBSS to other diffusion-derived data
  than FA images. For example, you may be interested in how MD (mean
  diffusivity) or the first diffusion tensor eigenvalue varies between
  different subjects.

<p>To achieve this we recommend using the FA images to achieve the
  nonlinear registration and skeletonisation stages, and also to
  estimate the projection vectors from each individual subject onto
  the mean FA skeleton. The nonlinear warps and skeleton projection
  can then also be applied to other images such as the second
  eigenvalue. The following instructions assume that you want to run
  TBSS on the second eigenvalue, named L2 by dtifit:

<UL>

<LI>Run the full TBSS analysis (see all steps above) on your FA data.

<LI>Create a new directory called L2 (or any other name) in your TBSS
  analysis directory (the one that contains the
  existing <code>origdata</code>, <code>FAi</code>
  and <code>stats</code> directories from the FA
  analysis):<br><code>mkdir L2</code>

<LI>Copy your L2 images into this new directory, making sure that they
  are named <b>exactly</b> the same as the original FA images were (look in
  <code>origdata</code> to check the original names).

<LI>Making sure that you are in the L2 directory,
  run <code>tbss_1_preproc</code>, using a sensible scaling argument
  (which in general will be different from <a href="#1">the scaling
  needed for the original FA data</a>), for example:<br><code>cd L2 ;
  tbss_1_preproc -f 1000000 *.nii.gz</code>

<LI>Now go back up one directory to your top working TBSS directory
  (the one that now contains FAi, stats and L2 subdirectories) and run
  the <code>tbss_non_FA</code> script, telling it that the alternate
  data is called L2. This will apply the original nonlinear
  registration to the L2 data, merge all subjects' warped L2 data into
  a 4D file <code>stats/all_L2</code>, project this onto the original
  mean FA skeleton (using the original FA data to find the projection
  vectors), resulting in the 4D projected data
  <code>stats/all_L2_skeletonised</code>:<br><code>cd .. ; tbss_non_FA
  L2</code>

<LI>You can now run voxelwise stats on the projected 4D
  data <code>all_L2_skeletonised</code> <a href="#5">in the same
  manner as described above</a>.

<a name="display"></a><p><hr><H2>Displaying TBSS Results</H2>

<p><img src="stats_eg.png" align="right">In this section we give some
  hints on how to present TBSS results. You might want to use either
  the MNI152 background image or your mean_FA study-specific image -
  or you may want to show TBSS results on top of both. If you use your
  mean_FA image as the background, make sure that you set a good
  display range, for example 0:6000. For the rest of this section
  we'll assume that you want to show results on top of the MNI152
  image and hence start by loading MNI152 into FSLView.

<p>You will probably next want to load the mean_FA_skeleton image on
  top of your background image, to show where the skeleton was
  estimated, and which standard-space voxels were tested in the
  multi-subjects statistics. Load mean_FA_skeleton into FSLView and
  set its display range correctly. The lower threshold <b>must</b> be
  set to the threshold that you used in the TBSS analysis, for example
  2000. The upper level should probably be set to something like 7000,
  so that you can see variation in mean FA values within the
  skeleton. You probably want to change the colourmap, for example to
  Green, and increase the transparency (with the transparency slider)
  so that when you load the stats image in, it is easier to see.

<p>Finally, load the stats image in. If you have used cluster-based
  testing in randomise, the raw t-statistic image will be named
  something like <code>tbss_tstat1</code> (which you could view to see
  raw tstats before significance testing), but the image you probably
  want is <code>tbss_maxc_tstat1</code>, which is the p-value image
  (actually the values in this image are 1-p for ease of display, so
  that bigger is "better"). Load this into FSLView, set a colourmap
  such as Red-Yellow, and set the display range to something like
  0.95:1, which corresponds to thresholding the results at p<0.05.

<p>All of the above (apart from setting the skeleton transparency,
  which has to be done by hand in the GUI) can be carried out with a
  single command (see first example image):

<p><code>fslview MNI152 mean_FA_skeleton -l Green -b 2000,7000 tbss_maxc_tstat1 -l Red-Yellow -b 0.95,1</code>

<p><img src="stats_eg2.png" align="right">Alternatively, although showing the stats results on the TBSS
  skeleton is a true representation of the actual analysis carried
  out, some people find it easier to visualise the results if the
  skeletonised results are "thickened" somewhat. In order to make such
  a presentation easy, there is a script <code>tbss_fill</code>, which
  thickens the thresholded stats image, filling it out into the local
  "tracts" seen in mean_FA. For example, to apply this to the same
  example as above and then view in FSLView on top of the mean_FA
  image, run:

<p><code>tbss_fill tbss_maxc_tstat1 0.95 mean_FA tbss_fill<br>
fslview mean_FA -b 0,6000 mean_FA_skeleton -l Green -b 2000,7000 tbss_fill -l Red-Yellow</code>

<!-- {{{ back -->

<a name="back"></a><p><hr><H2>Transforming TBSS results back to native space</H2>

<p>It is possible to take one or more voxels on the mean FA skeleton
  and show where, in each subject's Fa image, those voxels originally
  came from. This "back projection" is composed of up to three
  steps. First, the skeleton voxel is projected back from its position
  on the skeleton to the nearby position at the centre of the nearest
  tract in the subject's FA image in standard space (i.e., after the
  FA image had been nonlinearly registered to the target
  image). Second, this point can then be "inverse warped" back into
  the subject's native space, by inverting the nonlinear registration
  that was originally applied. Finally, the native space image can be
  padded by a single slice on each side of the image cuboid, to match
  the original native space data (these end slices were removed when
  the data in FAi was originally created). The whole process can be
  viewed thus:

<p><center><img src="flowchart.png" width="100%"></center>

<p>There are two obvious reasons why you might want to back-project a
  skeleton-space voxel (or voxels). The first is to confirm that a
  given skeleton point was derived from the correct tract-centre
  points in all subjects. This can generally be achieve by just taking
  the first of the back projection steps, from the skeleton to the
  space of the all_FA data, and viewing the back-projected points on
  top of all_FA (looking at each subject, i.e., timepoint,
  separately). The second is to take a skeleton-space voxel or set of
  voxels (for example, a skeleton-space blob that is significantly
  different between the two groups of subjects in the study) back to
  the space of the original subjects' data, in order to run
  tractography for each subject, with that result forming the
  tractography seed mask.

<p><b>Option 1: just deproject &lt;skeleton-space-input-image&gt; onto the
    space of each nonlinearly registered subject in all_FA</b>

<p>For an example of confirming the final tract-centre projection
  stage, first form an image containing significant voxels from a
  previous randomise-based statistical analysis of the skeletonised
  data:

<p><pre>fslmaths tbss_maxc_tstat1 -thr 0.95 grot
tbss_deproject grot 1
fslview all_FA grot_to_all_FA -l Red-Yellow</pre>

<p>The <code>1</code> tells the script to just apply stage 1 of the
  de-projections, i.e. from skeleton space to the all_FA space. This
  lets you view the interesting skeleton-space voxels in the space of
  each subject's standard space (nonlinearly registered) FA image - as
  you move through the timepoints in FSLView you see each subject in
  turn.

<p><b>Option 2: do the first step and also invert the nonlinear warping, to
get back to subjects' native space in FAi</b>

<p>For an example of complete back-projection to the space of the
native data in FAi, run the following, first making sure you run the
command from within the <code>stats</code> directory. The
<code>2</code> flag tells the script to take the back-projection back
to the native space:

<p><pre>tbss_deproject grot 2</pre>

<p>This results in a separate output for each subject in the
<code>stats</code> directory. For example, if your first subject was
called <code>subject_001</code>, you would view the results (if you
are in the <code>stats</code> directory), with:

<p><code>fslview ../FAi/subject_001_FAi subject_001_FAi_grot -l Red-Yellow</code>

<p><b>Option 3: do the first two steps and also pad the end slices to get
    back to the subjects' native space in orig</b>

<p>If, instead, you want the final output in the original subject's
native space (this is very similar to the native space in FAi, just
with the end slices left in):

<p><pre>tbss_deproject grot 3
fslview ../orig/subject_001 subject_001_orig_grot -l Red-Yellow</pre>

<p>This is probably the space you want to transform <code>grot</code>
into if you are going to use the result to seed tractography analysis.

<p>Finally, you can add the <code>-n</code> flag to the end of the
<code>tbss_deproject</code> command to tell the transformations of
your original skeleton voxels to use nearest-neighbour interpolation
instead of trilinear. The advantage of trilinear is that you get a
more continuous interpolation of the skeleton voxels into native
space; the advantage of nearest-neighbour is that the exact
skeleton-space values are maintained, which might be important, for
example, if they are cluster index numbers.

<!-- {{{ what's new -->

<a name="new"></a><p><hr><H2>What's new in this version</H2>

<p><b>v1.1</b>

<p>This version introduced a standard-space mean FA image (FMRIB58_FA)
for use as the target in the initial nonlinear registration. This now
becomes the recommended target for the nonlinear registrations,
instead of registering every subject to every other subject, and
choosing the most typical. All scripts are updated to allow either way
of running the registrations.

<p>Script <code>tbss_fill</code> is added to allow "thickening" of
  results for ease of display.

<p>Script <code>tbss_deproject</code> is added to allow
back-projection of skeleton-space voxels into all_FA and native FA
spaces.

<p><b>v1.0</b>

<p>Original TBSS release.
