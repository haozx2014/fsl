Until this page is fully populated, see Jeanette Mumford's nice <a class="attachment" href="attachments/GLM/JMglm.pdf" title="intro slides on various GLM/ANOVA examples">intro slides on various GLM/ANOVA examples</a>. <span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><p class="line874">This is a work in progress - as we add in more details, we will also add in details on how the different rules do or don't apply across the different individual programs.  Many thanks to Jeanette Mumford and Tom Nichols for much work on this page. <span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><p class="line862">The foundation of statistical modelling in FSL is the general linear model (GLM), where the response <em>Y</em> at each voxel is modeled as a linear combination of one or more predictors, stored in the columns of a "design matrix" <em>X</em>.  Instead of directly specifying experimental designs (e.g. "Two-Sample t-test, 1 group of 5, one group of 8"), in FSL it is left up to the user to craft the matrix <em>X</em> that corresponds the experimental design and other effects to be modelled.   This is not a task to be taken lightly, and it is easy to create meaningless design matrices.  The notes below cannot be a substitute for study in statistical modelling, the GLM and (closely related) the general linear hypothesis. One recommended text book is "Applied Linear Statistical Models" (4th Edition or later), by Neter, Kutner, Wasserman and Nachtsheim; those with a more mathematical background may prefer "Plane Answers to Complex Questions" by Christensen. <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span>

<h3 id="Randomise_details">Randomise details</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><p class="line862">Strictly speaking, a one-sample permutation test is impossible.  Traditionally, a permutation test swaps labels between two groups of subjects (here impossible, as there is only one group) or shuffles the values of a covariate (the covariate is a column of ones, unaltered by permutation).  Only with an assumption of independent symmetric errors can a specialised test be performed, where, instead of permuting the data, each subject's data is multiplied by either +1 or -1.  Thus there are 2<sup>N</sup> possible sign flips.  This assumption is justified by the data consisting of differences where, under the null hypothesis, the subtracted data has the same distribution; equivalently, the data can be a COPE from a GLM and then the assumption is simply that the GLM errors are centered on zero and symmetrically distributed. <span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><p class="line862">Use the <tt class="backtick">-1</tt> option with randomise to indicate a one-sample t-test; see <a class="http" href="http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Randomise/UserGuide#One-Sample_T-test">Randomise examples</a> for more.  Significance for this test will indicate a positive effect, mean &gt; 0.  To obtain the negative effect, first multiply the original data used to test the positive mean (input_data) by -1 using: fslmaths input_data.nii.gz -mul -1 neg_input_data.nii.gz and then use neg_input_data.nii.gz in randomise.  In the example illustrated above, there are 8 subjects, and thus 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 possible permutations, and the smallest possible permutation P-value 1/256 = 0.0039. <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><p class="line867">

<h2 id="Two-Group_Difference_Adjusted_for_Covariate">Two-Group Difference Adjusted for Covariate</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-87"></span><p class="line874">This is an extension of the Two-Group difference.  It is often important to verify that any group differences cannot be explained by some other covariate, e.g. age or reaction time.  In this example there are 10 subjects split between two groups and the inference of interest is whether the group difference remains after adjusting for age.  Additionally, age inferences are also created. <span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span><p class="line867">
<h3 id="FEAT_details-4">FEAT details</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span><p class="line862">This is exactly the Two-Group Difference model, but with a single new regressor for Age added.  Age is mean centered in this model by <strong>subtracting the overall mean</strong> age from each individual age.  Importantly, this is done <strong>across <em>all</em> subjects and <em>not</em> within group</strong>.  Within-group mean centering will remove any ability of age to describe group differences and in this case your group difference inferences will <em>not</em> be adjusted for age.  The interpretation of C1 is Group1&gt;Group2, adjusted for age.  Likewise C2 is Group2&gt;Group1, adjusted for age.  C3 is the positive age effect and C4 is the negative age effect.  To adjust for multiple covariates, simply add more EVs to the model, one for each additionally covariate and mean center each covariate.  Even if you add a covariate like Gender, simply add a covariate that is 1 for one gender, 0 for the other and mean center this.

<span class="anchor" id="line-102"></span><p class="line862">This is an extension of the previous model.  There are again 10 subjects in 2 groups, but in this case the inference of interest is whether the linear relationship between the dependent variable and age differs between the two groups.  Importantly, this model should only be used to interpret the interaction and Group mean differences should not be studied where an interaction is significant, but the previous model should be used instead.  This is because a significant interaction indicates that the group difference varies as a function of age, therefore focusing on a single age is not likely all that interesting.  For more details on interpreting interactions, please refer to any introductory regression text book.  As mentioned above, "Applied Linear Statistical Models" by Neter <em>et al.</em> is a good reference.  Again, if you run this model and the interaction is not significant anywhere in the brain, use the simpler, Two-Group Difference Adjusted for Covariate, model described above.  If the interaction is significant, only the inferences for the interaction are of interest. <span class="anchor" id="line-103"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-104"></span><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-105"></span><p class="line862">The interaction model splits up the age covariate from the previous model into two EVs.  Again, Age is <strong>mean centered across <em>all</em> subjects</strong> before splitting into two EVs.  Significance of C1 indicates that the slope between your dependent variable and age for Group 1 is larger than that of Group 2.  C2 finds when the slope is larger for Group 2 than Group 2.

<span class="anchor" id="line-123"></span><p class="line867"><strong>Cell means model.</strong> We have 8 subjects and 1 factor at 4 levels A, B, C and D. The first two inputs are subjects in condition A, the next two are B etc.  This model setup is referred to as the "cell means" approach, as each regressor is modeling a single "cell" in the ANOVA (level A, level B, etc.).  This setup has the easiest interpretation in terms of studying individual cell means and cell mean comparisons, although the standard ANOVA F-test for any cell mean differences may not be as intuitive.  The overall F-test, tests whether mean(A)=mean(B)=mean(C)=mean(D), which is equivalent to mean(A)-mean(D)=mean(B)-mean(D)=mean(C)-mean(D)=0.  In this format it is easy to see that this F-test require simultaneously testing each mean's comparison to mean(D) or the following three contrasts: [ 1 0 0 -1], [0 1 0 -1] and [0 0 1 -1].  This F-test is set up in the GUI as well as the overall mean test, which averages the 4 cells using [0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25]. <span class="anchor" id="line-124"></span><div><table><tbody><tr>  <td><p class="line862"> <img alt="align=&quot;left&quot;" class="attachment" src="attachments/GLM/one_way_anova_4lev_cell_means.png" title="align=&quot;left&quot;" width="900" /> </td>

This model is equivalent to the cell means model, but the traditional ANOVA contrasts are easier to construct and this setup generalizes easier to more complicated ANOVA models (eg. the 3-factor 2-level model below).  This design setup always includes a column of 1s. Then, each factor will have as many EVs as the number of levels minus 1. In this case there is one factor with 4 levels and so 3 EVs are necessary to model the factor.  First choose a reference level (in this case we choose A) and for each EV rows of the design corresponding to A will have a 1 and there will not be a specific A-level EV.  For each level, construct an EV where the value is: -1 for level A, 1 for the level of interest, and 0 otherwise.  The first EV is -1 for A, 1 for B and 0 for C and D.  Similarly, the second EV is -1 for A, 1 for C and 0 for B and D.  Lastly, the third EV is -1 for A, 1 for D and 0 for B and C.  Last is the column of 1's. <span class="anchor" id="line-130"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-131"></span><p class="line874">Each of the first 3 EVs may appear to be the comparison of A to each level, but in reality EVs 1-3 are the comparisons of levels B, C, and D, respectively, to the overall mean.  As stated earlier this model makes it easier to test the standard ANOVA hypotheses.  The main effect for the factor is simply an F-test that combines individual tests for each of the EVs that were constructed for the factor effect (i.e. the first 3 EVs). <span class="anchor" id="line-132"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-133"></span><p class="line874">Obtaining inferences for cell means is not too difficult with this model either and the contrast is actually contained in the design matrix.  If the parameters estimated for this model are PE1, PE2, PE3 and PE4, matrix multiplication of the design with this parameter vector shows that all A-related values are equal to -PE1-PE2-PE3+PE4 and so the contrast to test the mean(A)=0 is [-1 -1 -1 1].  Likewise, the mean(B) corresponds to PE1+PE4 and the contrast is [1 0 0 1].  Lastly the mean(C) would be [0 1 0 1] and mean(D) would be [0 0 1 1]. <span class="anchor" id="line-134"></span><div><table><tbody><tr>  <td><p class="line862"> <img alt="align=&quot;left&quot;" class="attachment" src="attachments/GLM/one_way_anova_4lev_factor_eff.png" title="align=&quot;left&quot;" width="900" /> </td>

Following the rules state before, first determine how many EVs are required for each factor.  In this case there are two factors, each with 2 levels and so one EV is required to model each factor's main effect.  The interaction effect is constructed by multiplying these two EVs together, element-wise.  Starting with factor A, assign A1 as the reference level, so the A EV has a -1 for <tt class="backtick">A1</tt> and 1 for <tt class="backtick">A2</tt>.  Similarly, the B EB has a value of -1 for B1 and 1 for B2.  The interaction EV (3rd EV) is an element-wise product of the first 2 EVs.  Lastly is the column of 1s.  The F-test for the main A effect is simply and F-test that combines all individual contrasts for each A EV, in this case only the first.  Likewise for the main B effect.  The interaction effect, similarly, is an F-test on the interaction EV.  As described in the 1-factor 4-level ANOVA example, cell means can also be obtained from this model.  For example, multiplying the design matrix with the parameter vector, [PE1, PE2, PE3, PE4], yields -PE1-PE2+PE3+PE4 for all rows corresponding to <tt class="backtick">A1B1</tt> and so [-1 -1 1 1] is the contrast for <tt class="backtick">A1B1</tt>.

Following the steps for setting up a factor effects model, it is first determined that each factor will require a single EV (as each factor has 2 levels).  In this case there will be 3 possible 2-way interactions and 1 3-way interaction.  EV1 takes on a value of -1 for A1 and 1 for A2.  EV2 does the same for B and EV3 does the same for level C.  EV4 is the product of EVs 1 and 2 and is therefore the AB interaction.  Likewise EVs 5 and 6 are the AC and BC interactions.  Last EV7 is the 3-way interaction.

<span class="anchor" id="line-248"></span><p class="line874">This is a natural extension of the paired t-test, but the contrasts are slightly counter-intuitive so we explain this case in detail. We have 5 subjects, each scanned under 3 conditions, A, B and C. We enter the 5 condition A scans first, then 5 B and then 5 C. As with the paired t-test, EVs 3-7 simply remove the subject means and are not used in the contrasts. <span class="anchor" id="line-249"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-250"></span><p class="line874">We now want to form the 3 contrasts A-B, A-C and B-C. Note that, somewhat surprisingly, A-B is not given by [1 0 0...]! We define PE1=a and PE2=b. Then, we can see by looking at the three condition blocks, that the mean (on top of the global mean taken out by EVs 3-7) of condition A is modelled by A=a+b. Likewise, B=-a, and C=-b (look at the values in EVs 1 and 2). Therefore we have A-B = 2a+b = contrast [ 2 1 0....], and A-C = a+2b = contrast [ 1 2 0....], and B-C = -a+b = contrast [ -1 1 0....]. <span class="anchor" id="line-251"></span><div><table><tbody><tr>  <td><p class="line862"> <img align="left" alt="basis functions" class="attachment" src="attachments/FEAT(2f)UserGuide/eg3b.png" title="basis functions" /> </td>

<span class="anchor" id="line-294"></span><p class="line874">As mentioned earlier, the GLM is not designed to handle repeated measures, although if each subject has complete data (all 3 measures), it is possible to model this using the GLM under the assumption that the covariance between measures within-subject follows a compound symmetric structure.  Do not use this model unless all subjects have complete data.  As you may notice, this design setup resembles the factor-effects setup (see 2-factors 2-levels setup above).  The only difference is the column of 1's is replaced with EVs to model the means for each subject and the EV that would normally be included to model group (-1 for group1 and 1 for group 2) has been omitted as it would cause a rank-deficiency with the EVs modeling the subject-specific means.  It is not possible to look at group differences in this model as subject is treated as a random effect.  To do so, average the 2 measures within-subject and run a 2 group mean comparison on these data in a 3 level analysis approach.  Otherwise, the main effect for level is given by C1 and C2 tests the interaction of group and the other factor. <span class="anchor" id="line-295"></span><div><table><tbody><tr>  <td><p class="line862"> <img alt="align=&quot;left&quot;" class="attachment" src="attachments/GLM/two_grp_two_lev.png" title="align=&quot;left&quot;" width="900" /> </td>
