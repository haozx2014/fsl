Note that "sampling on the whole sphere" does <strong>not</strong> imply twice as many directions. From a diffusion perspective sampling along <strong>v</strong> and -<strong>v</strong> is exactly equivalent whereas from the perspective of eddy current distortions they are different. One can therefore have two sampling schemes that both sample the diffusion evenly and equally well (and with the same total acquisition time), but where one is on the half sphere and the other on the whole sphere. To make this concrete look at the two sampling schemes below. In these plots the end of each vector is marked with an x-marker. They sample the diffusion in exactly the same way <strong>but</strong> the one on the left facilitates correcting for eddy currents while the one on the right does <strong>not</strong>. Note also that either of these schemes can easily be created from the other. To for example transform the half sphere scheme to the whole sphere scheme one just need to replace half the vectors by their negations. <span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><div><table><tbody><tr>  <td><p class="line891"><img align="left" alt="whole_sphere_final.gif" class="attachment" src="attachments/eddy/whole_sphere_final.gif" title="whole_sphere_final.gif" width="400" /></td>
