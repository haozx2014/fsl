<H2>DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING</H2>
 
<p><br><H3>Downloading</H3>

<P> FSL is available precompiled for various different operating
systems (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, SunOS). The sources are also
available if you want to compile it yourself.

<P> <B><A HREF="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/"

<p><br><H3>Unpacking</H3>

<P>To unpack a distribution, you need gunzip and tar. First cd to the
directory where you want FSL installed (for example /usr/local). Then
uncompress and untar the distribution - for example, if you have
downloaded the Redhat 9 distribution to your home directory, type

<PRE>
gunzip ~/fsl-3.2-redhat9.tar.gz
tar xvf ~/fsl-3.2-redhat9.tar
</PRE>

<br><br><H3>Special instructions for installation if:</H3>

<LI><a href="macosx.html">You are installing on Mac OS X</a>

<LI><a href="windowsxp.html">You are installing on Windows XP</a>

<LI><a href="compiling.html">You are compiling the source distribution
instead of taking a binary distribution</a>

</UL>


<br><br><H3>Running</H3>

<P>Put the following somewhere in your shell setup file (.bashrc,
.profile, .cshrc etc., depending on what shell you use), setting the
"/usr/local/fsl" to wherever you have installed FSL:

<p><b>bash / sh / ksh</b><code><br>
FSLDIR=/usr/local/fsl<br>
. ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh<br>
PATH=${FSLDIR}/bin:${PATH}<br>
export FSLDIR PATH</code>

<p><b>tcsh / csh</b><code><br>
setenv FSLDIR /usr/local/fsl<br>
source ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.csh<br>
setenv PATH ${FSLDIR}/bin:${PATH}</code>

<P>To run the FSL tools from the command line, you can find the
tools in $FSLDIR/bin. In general command-line programs are lower case
(e.g. '<b>bet</b>'). In general the GUI version is capitalised
(e.g. '<b>Bet</b>'), except on Mac/Windows, where '_gui' is appended
because those file systems can't tell the difference between upper and
lower case (e.g. '<b>Bet_gui</b>').

<p>To bring up a simple GUI which is just a menu of the main
individual FSL GUI tools, just type <b>fsl</b>.


<br><br><H3>Customising (for different output datatypes, etc.) </H3>

<p>There are several environment variables which FSL uses to determine
certain user preferences, such as the output file format (NIFTI,
Analyze, etc). The defaults for these are set when you source the
setup file as shown above (i.e., ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh or
${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.csh). If you wish to change these defaults
then you need to:<pre>
cd
mkdir .fslconf
cd .fslconf</pre>

and in this directory create a file called fsl.sh or fsl.csh,
depending on the shell that you use, setting any or all of the
variables that appear in the central ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh or
${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.csh files. 
<p>
<b>
DO NOT copy the central files into <kbd>~/.fslconf/</kbd> as it
will cause a loop that will stop your login from working.
</b>
<p>
It is recommended that the files <kbd>~/.fslconf/fsl.sh</kbd> or
<kbd>~/.fslconf/fsl.csh</kbd> only include a few variable definitions
and nothing more.  Note that whoever installs FSL can also edit the
central files in <kbd>$FSLDIR/etc/fslconf</kbd> to change the
preferences for all users.
