+Description: GPU-accelerated tools for FSL
+ FSL is a comprehensive library of image analysis and statistical tools
+ for fMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data. The suite consists of various
+ command line tools, as well as simple GUIs for its core analysis pipelines.
+ Among others, FSL offers implementations of standard GLM analysis,
+ white matter tractography, tissue segmentation, affine and non-linear
+ co-registration, and independent component analysis.
+ .
+ This package provides accelerated versions of some FSL commands to utilize
+ NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit.
