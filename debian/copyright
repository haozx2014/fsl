This code comes from the CEPHES library. Although the library sources itself
contains no proper license statement, the copyright holder previously agreed
to release it under the terms of the GPL. This is documented in the Debian
packaging of the labplot package. Please see

http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/l/labplot/labplot_1.5.1-1/labplot.copyright

for references.

Here is a verbatim copy of the statement:

  This email from Steve Moshier, the copyright owner of cephes, to Helen 
  Faulkner (Debian maintainer of labplot), and other interested parties 
  (labplot and grace authors, grace maintainer and labplot sponsor), confirms 
  that we may release labplot with cephes licensed under the GPL.

  This is fine with me.  To acknowedge your terms explicily,
  how about augmenting the permission to read something like
  the following --

    This software is derived from the Cephes Math Library. It is
    incorporated herein, and licensed in accordance with DFSG,
    by permission of the author.


  If you are trying to get me to suggest a specific form for your
  license, then from looking at Debian programs such as dpkg it seems to
  me that you would find the GPL to be appropriate and the permission
  statement could reference one of the GPL documents instead of DFSG.
  Alternatively, the packages you have been talking about distributing
  with Debian presumably come with some sort of licenses and it would
  make sense to propose those licenses.
