Package maintainer comment:

As this license looks very restrictive the Debian package maintainer asked
upstream for clarification. Steve Smith answered:

"1. Only the SUSAN corner and edge detection are patented, not SUSAN
    smoothing, which is what we are using in FSL.
 2. We didn't derive the FSL smoothing code from the publically
    available SUSAN code (I wrote it and hence effectively sourced it
    independently) so it's not covered by the copyright on the 
    available SUSAN code."
