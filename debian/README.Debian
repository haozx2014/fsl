FSL for Debian
--------------

Most (if not all) FSL binaries require the presence of some environment 
variables set properly. To achieve this, one needs to source the FSL config
script, which is at /etc/fsl/fsl.sh.

The FSL user interface sometimes refers to an 'FSLDIR'. For Debian systems this
is /usr/share/fsl.
