fsl (4.1.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The /usr/bin convenience symlinks are now provided by the 'fsl-4.1'
    package itself, and are prefixed with the corresponding FSL version.
    For example, the 'slicer' command is available as 'fsl4.1-slicer'.
    This change prevents filename conflicts and allows multiple versions of a
    particular tool to coexist.

fsl (4.1.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The actual FSL suite is now provided by a versioned package 'fsl-4.1' that
    installs everything into version-specific locations to allow for parallel
    installations of multiple FSL major releases. Consequently the main
    installation directory has been moved to /usr/share/fsl/4.1/ and the
    configuration to /etc/fsl/4.1/. However, an 'fsl' package is still
    available that depends on the latest FSL version and provides convenience
    symlinks for all FSL tools on /usr/bin. If the 'fsl' package is installed,
    FSL can now be used out-of-the-box and it is no longer necessary to manually
    modify the environment (e.g. by sourcing a config script). Please note,
    that the 'fsl' meta package is optional and can be removed if the offered
    convenience functionality is undesired, or a parallel installation of an
    older FSL version (prior 4.1) is needed.

fsl (4.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The new FNIRT tool replaces the previous IRTK, which has never been
    included in the Debian package, because it's sources were not available.
    With the arrival of FNIRT the Debian package is now (again) provides
    the full functionally of FSL.

fsl (3.3.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * FSL config file /etc/fsl/fsl.conf has been renamed to /etc/fsl/fsl.sh to
    be consistent with upstream FSL versions and to get correctly identified as
    a shell scripts.
