.SH "NAME"
fsl \- analysis tools for FMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBFSL\fR is a comprehensive toolkit for the analysis of medical brain
imaging data.  It provides tools for data preprocessing, brain
extraction, image registration as well as a broad spectrum of statistical
analyses.
\fBFSL\fR provides an easy to use GUI.
.PP
\fBFSL\fR requires a number of environment variables to be set properly.
To achieve this, please source the config script from /etc/fsl/#FSLMVERSION#/fsl.sh.  One way
to do this automatically is to add a line containing
.IP
 \. /etc/fsl/#FSLMVERSION#/fsl.sh
.PP
to the .bashrc file in a users home directory (or a corresponding file
for other shells than bash). You may need to create such a file first.
.PP
Alternatively, the Debian package installs symlinks for all FSL tools in
/usr/bin that take care of loading the appropriate configuration automatically.
The symlink names are prefixed with the corresponding \fBFSL\fR version to
prevent filename conflicts and allow multiple version to coexist on the same
system. For example, the \fBslicer\fR command is available as
\fBfsl#FSLMVERSION#-slicer\fR. Please note that for using \fBFSL\fR tools via
these symlinks it is \fBnot\fR necessary to perform the setup procedure
describe above. However, this convenience feature is Debian-specific. Scripts
that employ FSL commands and are intended to be shared with others should rely
on unprefixed command names and the FSL environment variable setup.
.PP
The \fBFSL\fR user interface sometimes refers to an \fBFSLDIR\fR. On Debian
systems this is \fI/usr/share/fsl/#FSLMVERSION#\fR for FSL version #FSLMVERSION#.
.PP
\fBFSL\fR documentation and online help is provided by the \fBfsl-#FSLMVERSION#-doc\fR
package.

Questions regarding the usage of \fBFSL\fR or related theory can be
posted on the
\fBFSL mailing list\fR (see \fIhttp://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/fsl.html\fR).
.SH "PARALLELIZATION"
FSL can be configured to submit jobs to a running Sun Gridengine (SGE). While
not all functionality implemented in FSL supports this kind of parallelization,
the most demanding processing tools (e.g. POSSUM and FDT) do.
.PP
FSL should be able to use SGE even if the SGE_ROOT environment variable is not
set, as in the case of the Debian package of SGE. To enable batch processing
simply set
.IP
FSLPARALLEL=1
.PP
in the shell where FSL is running. This can be enabled permanently in
.IP
/etc/fsl/#FSLMVERSION#/fsl.sh
.PP
or on a case by case basis.
