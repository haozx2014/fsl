.SH "NAME"
fsl \- analysis tools for FMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBFSL\fR is a comprehensive toolkit for the analysis of medical brain
imaging data.  It provides tools for data preprocessing, brain
extraction, image registration as well as statistical analysis.
\fBFSL\fR provides an easy to use GUI.
.PP
\fBFSL\fR requires a number of environment variables to be set properly.
To achieve this, please source the config script from /etc/fsl/4.1/fsl.sh.  One way
to do this automatically is to add a line containing
.IP
 \. /etc/fsl/4.1/fsl.sh
.PP
to the .bashrc file in a users home directory (or a corresponding file
for other shells than bash).
.PP
Alternatively, one may install the \fBfsl\fR package that provides symlinks to
all FSL tools in /usr/bin and takes care of loading the appropriate
configuration. Please note that this convenience functionality is only available
for the latest FSL version. In case of a parallel installation of multiple FSL
major releases, the matching config file for older FSL releases needs to be
sourced manually.
.PP
\fBFSL\fR documentation and online help is provided by the \fBfsl-doc-4.1\fR
package.
.PP
Questions regarding the usage of \fBFSL\fR or related theory can be
posted on the
\fBFSL mailing list\fR (see \fIhttp://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/fsl.html\fR).
.SH "PARALLELIZATION"
FSL can be configured to submit jobs to a running Sun Gridengine (SGE). While
not all functionality implemented in FSL supports this kind of parallelization,
the most demanding processing tools (e.g. POSSUM and FDT) do.
.PP
FSL should be able to use SGE even if the SGE_ROOT environment variable is not
set, as in the case of the Debian package of SGE. To enable batch processing
simply set
.IP
FSLPARALLEL=1
.PP
in the shell where FSL is running. This can be enabled permanently in
.IP
/etc/fsl/4.1/fsl.sh
.PP
or on a case by case basis.
