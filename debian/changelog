fsl (5.0.8-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Disable unecessary unportable debugging code that breaks on kfreebsd.

fsl (5.0.8-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove versioned dependencies on transitional packages libgd2-(no)xpm-dev
    in favor of a dependency on libgd-dev (Closes: #792291). Thanks to
    Mattia Rizzolo for the report.
  * Add patch to force FSL to use its own modified version of the BWidget
    TCL package. This prevents incompatibility issues if a system-wide
    BWidget installation is found (Closes: #792758). The "fix" forces a
    version requirement on BWidget 1.8 (matches embedded version,
    Debian has 1.9.x as of now). This is not ideal, but a minimally intrusive
    change that achieves the desired behavior. Thanks to Vincent Kersten
    for the report.
  * Move upstream meta data to debian/upstream/metadata.
  * Drop embeded excanvas javascript library in favor of a dependency on
    libjs-excanvas.

    as a Mac (Closes: #755356).

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Jul 2014 11:36:26 +0200

fsl (5.0.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a patch to make randomise_parallel work on systems that do not have
    bash as their default shell (Closes: #693373). Thanks to Philip Chase for
    the patch.
  * Add a patch to honor an unset FSLPARALLEL (do not submit jobs to a
    cluster) even in cases where SGE_ROOT is set (Closes: #685757). Thanks to
    German Gomez-Herrero for the patch.
  * Sanitize PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH when sourcing the configuration file.
    Old/duplicate FSL path entries are now removed (Closes: #695257). Thanks
    to Vincent Kersten for the patch.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Jul 2014 15:44:44 +0200

fsl (5.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - new component: gps
  * Remove the documentation from the source package due to a number of files
    with unclear origin and license. Consequently, the -doc has been removed
    as well. Upstream confirms that documentation is best consumed from the
    live wiki on the project homepage.
  * Move the -gpu package setup into a patch that can be applied to backports
    to particular releases. The current Debian unstable doesn't have a
    functional nvcc and it is i386 and amd64 only anyway.
  * Cleanup and remove old and merged patches.
  * Bumped Standard version to 3.9.5 -- no changes necessary.

    - An error with voxelwise regressors in lower-level FEAT introduced in
      FSL 5.0.5 has been fixed. It is stringly recommend to re-run any
      lower-level FEAT analysis that used voxelwise regressors (e.g. PNM)
      generated with FSL 5.0.5.
    - Bugfixes for POSSUM and the ASL GUI.

fsl (5.0.2-4) neurodebian; urgency=low

  * Removed left-over debug statement that broke fsl_sub again.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Jan 2012 15:26:26 +0100

fsl (5.0.2-3) neurodebian; urgency=low

  * Modifications of fsl_sub behavior and configuration:
    - Add a configuration option to fsl.sh (FSLCLUSTER_DEFAULT_QUEUE) to
      specify a default queue for job submissions. This can be used to amend
      the default queue selection by resource demands.
    - Fix a bug in the Debian patch where job submission fails when fsl_sub is
      called without -q.
    - Fix a bug to actually honor the FSLCUSTER_MAILOPTS variable when set.
    - Restructure and minimize the upstream diff in fsl_sub to make it less
      likely to break again with future upstream changes.

fsl (5.0.2-1) neurodebian; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release.

fsl (5.0.1-1) neurodebian; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release. It fixes some critical issues with FEAT
    (was crashing) and post-hoc output timecourses in MELODIC.
  * Stop regenerating tclIndex during postinst. This is no longer necessary
    since libfslio and its TCL scripts are built from the FSL source package
    -- which is since 4.1.1 or four years (Closes: #689166).

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Thu, 06 Sep 2012 09:10:33 +0200

fsl (4.1.9-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix release.
  * Bumped Standard version to 3.9.3 -- no changes necessary.
  * Adjustments for Octave transition: changed dependencies in debian/control,
    make call to octave-depends conditional upon its presence to allow for
    easy backports (Closes: #674426)
  * Move fsl.css from -doc into the main package to prevent error message due
    to failed access to this file when the -doc package is not installed.
    (Closes: #675195)

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Fri, 01 Jun 2012 10:35:16 +0200

fsl (4.1.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

    redefines LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Courtesy of Duncan Mortimer.
  * Added initial support for using Condor for cluster support instead of
    SGE (FSLPARALLEL=condor).

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Dec 2011 19:24:00 +0100

fsl (4.1.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream relase. Merged patches (gdc_bugfix, missing_newline,
    gcc_compat).
  * Make fslview recommended (instead of depend), as it is currently not
    available for post-squeeze systems, due to VTK5-Qt3 dependency.
  * Remove brace expansion in debhelper install file (reported by lintian).

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Oct 2011 15:06:03 +0200

fsl (4.1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release.
  * Install README.Debian into the versioned FSL package.

fsl (4.1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release. Improved TFCE handling in fslmaths. Better
    error detection in randomise. MELODIC now has an option to use a
    user-defined seed. There are a number of minor fixes to FEAT. fslmerge
    now attempts to detect orientation problems during a temporal merge.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Jan 2011 14:19:59 -0500

fsl (4.1.6-5) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Added clarification to the manpage that a .bashrc might not exist and
    would have to be created.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Tue, 28 Sep 2010 17:00:39 -0400

fsl (4.1.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove /usr/bin symlinks from 'fsl' package and remove now obsolete
    package conflicts (Closes: #592242 again). Instead, the 'fsl-4.1' package
    now installs properly prefixed ('fsl4.1-') symlinks into /usr/bin that do
    not conflict with existing files in any package and, moreover, allow tools
    from multiple FSL versions to coexist on the same system. Any internal FSL
    scripts are unaffected by this change. Adjust manpage and README.Debian to
    document this change, as well as added a NEWS entry.
  * Bumped Standard version to 3.9.1.0 -- no changes necessary.
  * Removed menu integration of 'Nudge' tool to prevent overcrowding of menu
    categories. It is of limited functionality and rarely used.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Fri, 03 Sep 2010 09:35:39 -0400

fsl (4.1.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add package conflict between 'fsl' and 'cyrus-clients-2.2', due to file
    conflict (Closes: #592242). Thanks to Ralf Treinen for detecting.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Sun, 08 Aug 2010 12:20:38 -0400

fsl (4.1.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install package content into version-specific locations to allow multiple
    major FSL release to coexist on the same system (Closes: #546241). The
    previous unversioned 'fsl' package remains and serves as a meta package
    that depends on the latest versioned FSL package and installs wrappers
    for all binaries into /usr/bin that can be used without manually sourcing
    a config file first. This change is based on work by Mark Hymers -- Thanks!
  * Add package conflicts to 'yagiuda', 'kolab-cyrus-clients', 'multimail',
    and 'im' due to namespace conflicts of symlinks in /usr/bin installed by
    the new FSL meta package. The versioned FSL packages are usable without the
    meta package (in case someone installs these packages on a neuroscience
    workstation) and the added convenience of a readily usable FSL (without
    manual environment tweaks) seems to outweigh the disadvantages.
  * Adjust build-dependency on libnifti1-dev to libnifti-dev.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Sun, 25 Jul 2010 11:12:30 -0400

fsl (4.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Merged various patches with upstream.
    Closes: #581095.

fsl (4.1.5.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch to source package format 3.0 (quilt). Convert all Git
    feature/bugfix branches into quilt patch series.
  * Remove obsolete dh_desktop call from debian/rules.
  * Add debhelper dependency variables to fsl-doc control stanza.
  * No longer compile with '-Wl,--as-needed' to prevent symbols from
    libcprob to be substituted by external replacements.
  * Updated and extended the package description.
  * Changed maintainer to NeuroDebian. Moved myself into uploaders and
    added Yaroslav Halchenko.
  * Fix syntax error in 'rotate_bvecs' script.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Sun, 02 May 2010 19:19:25 -0400

fsl (4.1.5.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix broken fslmaths option (-tfce). Thanks to Clark Johnson and Matthew
    Webster.
  * Bumped Standard version to 3.8.4.0 -- no changes necessary.
  * Remove support for octave2.1 dependency and allow for octave3.2.
    Thanks to Thomas Weber for the report (Closes: #572763).

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Sat, 06 Mar 2010 08:28:38 -0500

fsl (4.1.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream service release. Fixes issues with broken FNIRT scripts.

    Petr Hlustík for reporting.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Thu, 28 Jan 2010 09:27:57 -0500

fsl (4.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    * An issue with Randomise "pausing" has been fixed.
    * There are some improvements to the bedpostx monitor script.
    * Large speedup for invwarp by automatically adjusting the useful FOV
      internally (no cropping of the original images needed).
    * Non-linear initialisation in bedpostx to allow better convergence of
      the MCMC chains
    * Some improvements and new options in Probtrackx:
      - allows to input nonlinear (FNIRT) warpfield instead of FLIRT
        matrices
      - bug fix in initial fibre selection
      - tracking from freesurfer cortical surface (into the brain)
      - tracking from random locations within a seed voxel
  * No longer compile with '-ansi -pedantic', since a significant part of the
    sources is actually not ANSI compliant (Closes: #546003).
  * Don't use roundl() to round doubles in src/basisfield/splinefield.cpp to
    prevent FTFBS on ARMEL (Closes: #513272).
  * Bumped Standard version to 3.8.3.0 -- no changes necessary.
  * New config variable FSLPARALLEL. If set, FSL will submit jobs to a running
    Sun Gridengine. By default, this setting is disabled in /etc/fsl/fsl.sh.
    (Closes: #546238). Added suggested package 'gridengine-client'.
    See README.Debian for more information.
  * Remove all menu items of GUI-apps that are directly accessible from the
    central FSL GUI. The menu got too crowded with all the different FSL
    items.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Fri, 22 Jan 2010 18:01:24 -0500

fsl (4.1.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include a number of upstream patches that went into 4.1.4 after the
    4.1.4-1 package got uploaded.
  * Revert from -O3 to -O2 for compiler optimizations. -O3 seems to cause
    trouble for some pieces (miscmaths, avwutils) on some architectures.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Wed, 03 Jun 2009 20:52:45 +0200

fsl (4.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Fixed bashisms (Closes: #530084).

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Sat, 23 May 2009 11:47:34 +0200

fsl (4.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version.
  * Reverse the order of the octave*-headers build-dependency alternatives
    to account for the removal of octave2.1-headers from unstable
    (Closes: #523826).
  * Do not build-depend on FSLView anymore. That setup was way to complex and
    error-prone.
  * Bumped Standard version to 3.8.1 -- no changes necessary.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Mon, 27 Apr 2009 22:13:12 +0200

fsl (4.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use internals libs compiled by the fslview package, instead of building
    them again from fsl sources.
  * Added 'XS-DM-Upload-Allowed: yes' in debian/control.
  * Install fslio im* scripts.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Sat, 07 Feb 2009 10:33:03 +0100

fsl (4.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version.
  * Added POSSUM installation directory to environment setup -- it refused to
    work otherwise.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Fri, 05 Dec 2008 10:23:08 +0100

fsl (4.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compile and use fslio library version that comes with the FSL sources.
    This fixes a bug when FSL 4.1 is used with ANALYZE images, which it
    cannot reliably do anymore (only NIfTI is supported). Also updated the
    configuration documentation (in /etc/fsl/fsl.sh) accordingly.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Fri, 24 Oct 2008 12:27:38 +0200

fsl (4.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version fixing a number of bugs in FEAT, FDT and FNIRT.
  * Updated repackaging. Repackaging procedure was changed to keep fslio in
    the package. This version contains more up-to-date scripts than the ones
    in the nifticlibs package.
  * Install im* and tcl scripts from local fslio sources, instead of using the
    (discontinued) ones in the nifticlibs package. Therefore also removing
    dependency to 'nifti-bin'.
  * Do not install installer script -- useless on Debian (Closes: #489596).
  * Remove broken get-orig-source target from debian/rules. The repackaging
    procedure is implemented in the 'repackage-fsl' script shipped with the
    fslview package.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Thu, 16 Oct 2008 14:28:34 +0200

fsl (4.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

    to /bin/sh. This caused the script to fail on Ubuntu systems that have
    dash as their default shell.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Thu, 30 Aug 2007 08:44:46 +0200

fsl (4.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Repackaged the FSL source tarball due to its size and the mixture of
    licenses and split it into three independent source packages: 'fsl' contains
    all non-free source code, 'fslview' contains FSLView and all other
    DFSG-compliant sources and 'fsldata' contains the arch-independent datasets
    (>900MB).
  * Conflict with old fsl-fslview package and depend on the successor
    'fslview'.
  * Debian diff is now handled with a GIT repository. Build-dependency to
    dpatch is obsolete.
  * All internal libraries are compiled as shared libraries with
    -W,l--no-undefined to be able to detect unresolved symbols that have been
    an issue in the past. This also reduces the size of the binary package
    significantly.
  * FSL now uses libfslio, libniftiio and the im* tools from the corresponding
    Debian packages instead of a compiling a local copy.
  * Added 'dicomnifti' to the list of the suggested packages.
  * Removed obsolete runtime dependency to tix, imagemagick and gnuplot.

fsl (3.3.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed manpage links of FSL internal cmdline tools to prevent namespace
    conflicts.
  * Disabled FSL developer variables in /etc/fsl/fsl.conf to prevent error
    messages when the file is sourced, but no compiler is installed.
  * Added wrapper script (similar to ssh-argv0) to be able to automatically
    source the FSL configuration on startup. This adds the opportunity to
    include menu and .desktop files.
  * Add proper menu and .desktop files for all FSL GUI applications.
  * Added build-depend on imagemagick to be able to generate a 32x32 icon for
    the FSL menu entries from included artwork.
  * Renamed fsl config file from fsl.conf to fsl.sh. This is done to reduce
    the differences between upstream releases and the Debian package.
    A preinst script was added to move old config files on package upgrades.
    The new behavior is noted in debian/NEWS.
  * Added XS-Vcs-Svn and XS-Vcs-Browser to debian/control.
  * Added comments about the CEPHES and Susan licensing to debian/copyright.
  * Added a link to the FSLView binary to /usr/share/fsl/bin, because Nudge
    was complaining about not beeing able to find it. Thanks to Yaroslav
    Halchenko for pointing at this issue.
  * Added manpage for fslview.

fsl (3.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (missed 3.3.3). FSLView source code is now included,
    but FSLView still cannot be build, because it build-depends on VTK 5.0.
    No Debian package of this version is currently available.
  * Added build conflict to libnifti0-dev. FSL sources contain an incompatible
    fork of this library. This situation should vanish with the next major
    release.

    library (Thanks to Philippe Coval).
