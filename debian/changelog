fsl (4.1.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reverse the order of the octave*-headers build-dependency alternatives
    to account for the removal of octave2.1-headers from unstable
    (Closes: #523826).

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Tue, 14 Apr 2009 01:50:41 +0200

fsl (4.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use internals libs compiled by the fslview package, instead of building
    them again from fsl sources.
  * Added 'XS-DM-Upload-Allowed: yes' in debian/control.
  * Install fslio im* scripts.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Sat, 07 Feb 2009 10:33:03 +0100

fsl (4.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version.
  * Added POSSUM installation directory to environment setup -- it refused to
    work otherwise.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Fri, 05 Dec 2008 10:23:08 +0100

fsl (4.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compile and use fslio library version that comes with the FSL sources.
    This fixes a bug when FSL 4.1 is used with ANALYZE images, which it
    cannot reliably do anymore (only NIfTI is supported). Also updated the
    configuration documentation (in /etc/fsl/fsl.sh) accordingly.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Fri, 24 Oct 2008 12:27:38 +0200

fsl (4.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version fixing a number of bugs in FEAT, FDT and FNIRT.
  * Updated repackaging. Repackaging procedure was changed to keep fslio in
    the package. This version contains more up-to-date scripts than the ones
    in the nifticlibs package.
  * Install im* and tcl scripts from local fslio sources, instead of using the
    (discontinued) ones in the nifticlibs package. Therefore also removing
    dependency to 'nifti-bin'.
  * Do not install installer script -- useless on Debian (Closes: #489596).
  * Remove broken get-orig-source target from debian/rules. The repackaging
    procedure is implemented in the 'repackage-fsl' script shipped with the
    fslview package.

    package to determine octave paths.

fsl (4.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Some bugfixes in bet2 and possum.

    (Closes: #460270).

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Wed, 23 Jan 2008 17:09:38 +0100

fsl (4.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Refurbished debian/rules. Now honours 'noopt' and builds with debugging
    symbols by default.
  * Make Debian diff less intrusive by moving more logic into debian/rules.
  * Improve LD_LIBRARY_PATH handling by preventing trailing colons.
  * Let fsl-doc depend on fslview-doc to prevent dangling symlink.

  * Updated and completed list of licenses in debian/copyright.
  * Removed empty directories from the fsl-doc package.
  * Placed fsl-doc package in section non-free/doc.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Mon, 12 Nov 2007 22:38:01 +0100

    actually a mixed sh and tclsh script.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Wed,  5 Sep 2007 22:28:01 +0200

fsl (4.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Sat, 01 Sep 2007 10:53:23 +0200

fsl (4.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: fsl_sub made use of non-POSIX operator while interpreter was set
    to /bin/sh. This caused the script to fail on Ubuntu systems that have
    dash as their default shell.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Thu, 30 Aug 2007 08:44:46 +0200

fsl (4.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Repackaged the FSL source tarball due to its size and the mixture of
    licenses and split it into three independent source packages: 'fsl' contains
    all non-free source code, 'fslview' contains FSLView and all other
    DFSG-compliant sources and 'fsldata' contains the arch-independent datasets
    (>900MB).
  * Conflict with old fsl-fslview package and depend on the successor
    'fslview'.
  * Debian diff is now handled with a GIT repository. Build-dependency to
    dpatch is obsolete.
  * All internal libraries are compiled as shared libraries with
    -W,l--no-undefined to be able to detect unresolved symbols that have been
    an issue in the past. This also reduces the size of the binary package
    significantly.
  * FSL now uses libfslio, libniftiio and the im* tools from the corresponding
    Debian packages instead of a compiling a local copy.
  * Added 'dicomnifti' to the list of the suggested packages.
  * Removed obsolete runtime dependency to tix, imagemagick and gnuplot.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Fri, 17 Aug 2007 14:38:14 +0200

fsl (3.3.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed manpage links of FSL internal cmdline tools to prevent namespace
    conflicts.
  * Disabled FSL developer variables in /etc/fsl/fsl.conf to prevent error
    messages when the file is sourced, but no compiler is installed.
  * Added wrapper script (similar to ssh-argv0) to be able to automatically
    source the FSL configuration on startup. This adds the opportunity to
    include menu and .desktop files.
  * Add proper menu and .desktop files for all FSL GUI applications.
  * Added build-depend on imagemagick to be able to generate a 32x32 icon for
    the FSL menu entries from included artwork.
  * Renamed fsl config file from fsl.conf to fsl.sh. This is done to reduce
    the differences between upstream releases and the Debian package.
    A preinst script was added to move old config files on package upgrades.
    The new behavior is noted in debian/NEWS.
  * Added XS-Vcs-Svn and XS-Vcs-Browser to debian/control.
  * Added comments about the CEPHES and Susan licensing to debian/copyright.
  * Added a link to the FSLView binary to /usr/share/fsl/bin, because Nudge
    was complaining about not beeing able to find it. Thanks to Yaroslav
    Halchenko for pointing at this issue.
  * Added manpage for fslview.

  * New upstream release.
  * Minor bugfixes fixes to avwmerge++ and avwmaths++.
  * Modified FSLView makefile to fix FTBFS due to missing fslio linrary.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Fri, 12 Jan 2007 10:42:06 +0100

fsl (3.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (missed 3.3.3). FSLView source code is now included,
    but FSLView still cannot be build, because it build-depends on VTK 5.0.
    No Debian package of this version is currently available.
  * Added build conflict to libnifti0-dev. FSL sources contain an incompatible
    fork of this library. This situation should vanish with the next major
    release.

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Wed, 26 Apr 2006 10:51:08 +0200

  * Improved patch to FAST for GCC4 compatiility.
  * Removed libcprob and newran from the tarball, since they are unnecessary
    for building FSL.

    official Debian libgdchart-gd2 package instead of compiling the custom
    version from the FSL source tarball.
  * Switch package dependency for newmat to a package that provides a shared
    library (Thanks to Philippe Coval).

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Sun, 19 Feb 2006 22:05:24 +0100

fsl (3.2beta-2) unstable; urgency=low

fsl (3.2beta-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release (Closes: #332666).

    in debian/rules).
  * Includes some fixes for compatibility with GCC4 (thanks to Andre Piel).

 -- Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>  Wed, 28 Dec 2005 17:11:34 +0100
